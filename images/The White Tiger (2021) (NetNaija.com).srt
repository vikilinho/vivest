I know you Chinese are great lovers
of freedom and individual liberty.

57
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,083
The British tried
to make you their servants,

00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,833
but you never let them.

59
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
I admire that, Mr. Premier.

After them, my sly, old Granny, Kusum.

She had forced my brother,
Kishan, to work in the tea shop.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,833
And she took every rupee
from my father, a rickshaw puller.

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,833

00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,291
in its 10,000-year history…

173
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,500
the rooster coop.

174
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,666
They can see and smell the blood.

175
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,083
They know they are next,
yet they don't rebel.

176
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,083
They don't try and get out of the coop.

177
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,166
Servants here
have been raised to behave the same.

178
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,375
[rickshaw bell rings]

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,958
The furniture on his back
is worth at least two years his salary,

180
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,500
and yet he will faithfully pedal
the money back to his boss

181
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,083
without ever touching a single rupee.

182
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
No servant does.

183
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:43,208
Why? Because Indians are the world's
most honest and spiritual people?

184
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
No.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,208
It's because 99.9% of us
are caught in the rooster coop.

186
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,041
The trustworthiness
of servants is so strong

187
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,583
that you can put
the key of emancipation in a man's hand

188
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,416
and he will throw it
back at you with a curse.

189
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,250
[indistinct chatter]

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,375
I had learned to use my time
to eavesdrop on customers,

191
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
waiting for an opportunity.

192
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
[in Hindi] Would you like some tea?
Put on some tea!

193
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
[in English] Something my brother
had given up on long ago.

194
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,791
[in Hindi] Make it quickly.

195
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,625
[indistinct chatter]

196
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,333
Are you deaf? Get to work.

[car honking]

199
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,750
[children chattering]

200
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,916
[Balram in English] I know communists
like you don't believe in God, sir,

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,166
but do you believe in fate?

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,833
That was when I first saw him,
the Stork's youngest son, Mr. Ashok.

203
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,833
He had just moved from America
back to India, to Dhanbad,

204
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,250
where his family
had made a fortune in coal.

205
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,000
I knew then, this was the master for me.

206
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,458
[Balram in Hindi] I overheard them saying
they need a second driver for Mr. Ashok.

207
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
He's just come back--

208
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,041
But you don't know how to drive!

209
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:36,125
I just need 300 rupees
for the driving lessons and--

210
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,541
No! You've always
been insolent like your father.

211
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
You'll stay right here with Kishan.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,166
[Balram in English]
Granny had married him off,

213
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,708
given him two weeks
to dip his beak into his wife,

214
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,458
and now he was stuck here.

215
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,750
I would be too.

216
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,333
[in Hindi] Okay, forget it.

217
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,750
I thought if I became their driver,
you'd buy a bunch of water buffaloes…

218
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
and be the envy of the village.

219
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,375
So you'll become
a driver for the landlords?

220
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,041
You could be
the richest woman in the village.

221
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:15,375
[scoffs] Swear on all the gods
you believe in

222
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,708
that you'll send every rupee,

223
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,791
-every month, to your Granny.
-[repeats in Hindi]

224
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
-I swear.
-Stop smiling!

225
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,333
Pinch your hand and swear!

226
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,416
I'm pinching! Granny, just think…

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,875
You'll become
the richest woman in the village.

228
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,541
This cane will become gold,
and when you swing it like this,

229
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,666
the entire village
will line up to see you.

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
[Kishan] Wait! Granny made your favorite!

231
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,583
You eat your oily okra!
I'm gonna eat in Dhanbad!

232
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,958
[Kishan shouts in Hindi]

233
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,458
[men singing in Hindi]

234
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,208
[vehicles honking]

235
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,666
[Balram in English] And now,
I just had to learn to drive.

236
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,208
[instructor speaking Hindi]

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
[in English] Right. Right. Right.

238
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,666
[in Hindi] Watch out, sister-fucker!

239
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,125
You're from a caste of sweet makers.

240
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Only a boy from a warrior class
can tame a wild stallion.

241
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,250
Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs
have aggression in their blood.

242
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,291
Why don't you stick to making sweets?

243
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
[tires screeching]

244
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,083
It's not enough to drive.
You've got to become a driver.

245
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,625
Anyone tries to overtake you, do this…

246
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,541
Out of the way, sister-fucker!

247
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,708
[honking]

248
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,708
-[Balram] Outta my way, fucker!
-[driver cursing in Hindi]

249
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,708
The road is a jungle.

250
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,041
A good driver
must roar to get ahead on it!

251
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
-[engine revving]
-[honks]

252
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,958
[Balram in English] It wasn't
so hard to find out where they lived.

253
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,875
I just had to get through the door.

254
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,666
-[in Hindi] Yeah?
-Namaste, sir.

255
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,916
[in Hindi] What do you want?

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
Any need of a driver, sir?

257
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,750
I've got four years' experience.
My master recently died, so I--

258
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,750
Get lost. We have a driver already.

259
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,416
I see you have two cars, sir,
but do you have two drivers?

260
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,458
What's wrong with you?
Get lost, motherfucker.

261
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,458
Sir? This is your house?

262
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,375
[in English] Namaste, sir. I'm from
your village, sir! From Laxmangarh.

263
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,958
-[in Hindi] Laxmangarh?
-Yes, sir!

264
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,791
The gods must be watching over us!

265
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,833
[in English] I used to work at
the tea stall, sir, at the main junction!

266
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
And I would bring tea
to your Ambassador car.

267
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,250
-[speaks Hindi]
-Let the boy in.

268
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,083
-But, sir--
-[The Stork] Let him in.

269
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,541
I can't believe it's you, sir.

270
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,333
How the crops died since you left.

271
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
And we prayed that…

272
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,750
[in English] …you should have more sons
to keep rule in the village, sir.

273
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
[in Hindi] Get up.

274
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,750
[in English] Do people still remember me?

275
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,250
[in Hindi] Of course, sir.

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,666
[in English] We all say
our father is gone, sir.

277
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,291
The best and the most holy
of the landlords, like Gandhi-ji, sir.

278
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,333
Like Gandhi?

279
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,500
Ji, sir. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi-ji.

280
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay. Okay.

281
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,541
What do you want?

282
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,250
Sir, with your permission, sir,

283
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,125
I want to be a driver for you…
or for your son.

284
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,458
-Are you Muslim?
-[in Hindi] No, sir.

285
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,791
[in English] I bathe regularly,
keep myself clean, sir, and I'm not lazy.

286
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,875
-Hey, I'm Ashok.
-Hey, don't do that.

287
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,166
You need a driver,
let's take him for a spin.

288
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,833
-See how good he is.
-[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

289
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
[in English] Just my luck, the Mongoose.

290
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,083
-[The Stork in Hindi] He drives well.
-[in English] Yeah.

291
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,958
-[in Hindi] What's your caste?
-Halwai, sir.

292
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,666
Is that a high caste or low?

293
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,166
[Balram in English] In the old days,

294
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,250
when India was
the richest nation on Earth,

295
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,416
there were 1,000 castes and destinies.

296
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,625
These days, there are just two castes.

297
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,458
Men with big bellies
and men with small bellies.

298
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,958
And there are only two destinies,
eat or get eaten up.

299
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,875
-[in Hindi] Low caste, sir.
-Ugh!

300
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,916
-All our servants are high caste.
-[in English] Why does his caste matter?

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,791
-[in Hindi] You drink?
-No, sir.

302
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,500
-[in English] In my caste we never drink.
-So what do you do?

303
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,458
[in Hindi] Steal?

304
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,125
Halwai?

305
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,791
-You're a sweet maker?
-Yes, sir.

306
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,916
[in English] That's why
you're so sweet to us?

307
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,500
-Do you cook?
-Certainly, sir. Very well.

308
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,000
-Like what?
-Sir, all kinds of sweets, sir.

309
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,833
Gulab jamun, rasgulla ho gaya,
ladoo, rasmalai, kaju barfi.

310
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,416
[in Hindi] Whatever you like, sir.

311
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,541
[in English] The driver can cook too.
Only in India. Can you start tomorrow?

312
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Not so fast, bhai.
We'll have to check on his family first.

313
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,458
-[in Hindi] How much you want?
-I don't want any money, sir.

314
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,083
[in English] You are like parents to me.
How can I ask my parents for money?

315
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,416
Fifteen-hundred a month.

316
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,291
[in Hindi] No, sir, that's too much.

317
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,458
[in English] Give me
half of that, sir. It's enough.

318
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,541
If we keep you
beyond two months, it will go to 2,000.

319
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,000
And you only drive me.

320
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,958
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.

321
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,041
[honking]

322
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,375
-[in English] Can you honk less?
-[in Hindi] Bro, you wanna climb in here?

323
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,583
-Get moving!
-Watch how you drive!

324
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,791
-[in English] Why'd you do that? Don't.
-[in Hindi] Get the rod? Get the rod.

325
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,166
I know you're play-acting.
You haven't been hired yet, hick!

326
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,291
[Balram in English] The Mongoose
must have called his man in Laxmangarh,

327
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,041
because two days later
when they did hire me,

328
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
they knew everything about my family.

329
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:45,166
The pride and glory
of our nation, the Indian family.

330
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:52,041
Every master has to know exactly where
their servant's family live at all times

331
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,500
just in case a servant decides
to steal from his employer and run.

332
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,791
If so…

333
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,333
[gunshot]

334
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,291
Fair enough. I would do the same.

335
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,791
[man speaks Hindi]

336
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,666
[Balram in English]
But it's what the masters do

337
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,333
to their servants' families.

338
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,541
[gun cocking]

339
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,458
[gunshot]

340
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,458
This is how the rooster coop works.

341
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,250
This is how it traps so many millions
of men and women in India.

342
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,750
So rest assured, the Stork
and his sons could count on my loyalty.

343
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,000
[in Hindi] This is the room.

344
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,875
This is my room?

345
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,208
You'll share it with me.

346
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,666
I'll find a mattress
from the store for you.

347
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,291
No, there's no need for that.

348
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
I'll be quite comfortable on the floor.
Nothing to worry about.

349
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,708
-There's even a first class roof!
-[chuckles]

350
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Here. You're to wear this at all times.

351
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,958
-[Balram] It's mine?
-Yes.

352
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,541
-Hey, hero!
-Yes, sir?

353
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,166
I hope you like carpets.

354
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,208
When you're done cleaning those,
wash all the windows.

355
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,500
Got it?

356
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,083
But I'm the driver, sir.

357
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,791
No. You're the "number two" driver.

358
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,166
[speaking in Hindi]

359
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,125
[Balram in English]
Is there any hatred on Earth

360
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,416
like the hatred of the number-two servant
for the number one?

361
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,791
While I cleaned,
he strolled about like a master.

362
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,750
He had every Hindu God lined up
and was always praying,

363
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:07,000
as if to accuse me of being a Naxal,
a communist, like you, sir.

364
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,458
I would not let him out pray me.

365
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,333
[both singing in Sanskrit]

366
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,583
[in Hindi] Sir,
why is Ram Persad not eating?

367
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,875
-And his mouth stinks these days.
-You keep your mouth shut.

368
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,250
[continues speaking in Hindi]

369
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,916
[Balram in English]
This man was hiding something,

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,833
and a successful entrepreneur
always finds his competition's secrets.

371
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,916
[Ashok and Pinky grunt]

372
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,666
[Pinky] Good job. Good. Did you hear that?
Yeah, that was good, right?

373
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,125
Hey, driver!
Hey, driver. Can you come here, please?

374
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,875
[Pinky] All right,
I need you to lie down for this…

375
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,166
Hey! Come in.

376
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,625
I wanted to ask you some questions.

377
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,250
Hey, could you
turn around for me for a second?

378
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,708
-[Balram] Yes.
-[Pinky] No!

379
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,958
[chuckles] That's not what I meant.
Just stand here.

380
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,958
Um, I feel like your back's…

381
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,708
[Balram] I'm ashamed to admit it now,

382
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,583
but in that moment I thought
Mr. Ashok's wife, Pinky Madam,

383
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,208
was one of "those women."

384
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,666
[Pinky] Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't even introduce myself.

385
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,250
Hi, I'm Pinky. Nice to meet you.

386
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,541
Honey, honey, all right.
I need to talk to him.

387
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,375
-All right. Okay.
-I need to talk.

388
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,541
So, uh, driver. We're both…
I'm sorry. What's your name?

389
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,208
-Sir, Balram, sir.
-[Ashok] Yeah, Balram.

390
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,500
So, Balram,
do you know what the Internet is?

391
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,291
No, sir, but I could drive
to the market right now, sir,

392
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,500
and get as many as you want.

393
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,708
No, it's okay. Thank you.

394
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,291
Do you have Facebook?

395
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,208
Yes, sir. Books.
I always loved books, sir.

396
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah, I heard you can read.
Have you ever seen a computer?

397
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,375
Yes, sir. Actually, we had many of them
in the village, with the goats.

398
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,500
-[Ashok] Goats?
-Ji, sir.

399
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,000
The goats
are pretty advanced to use computers.

400
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,541
[Balram] I could tell from their faces
I had made a mistake.

401
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,666
Pinky, you see. He's got two,
three years schooling in him.

402
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,500
He can read and write,
but he doesn't get what he's read.

403
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,125
He's half-baked.

404
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,416
Okay, now you're being a jerk.
He's standing right there.

405
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,791
-I'm not being a jerk.
-[Pinky] Come on, Ashok.

406
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,166
You're missing the point, Pinky.

407
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,208
Our driver represents
the biggest untapped market in India,

408
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,166
waiting to surf the web, buy a cell phone,
rise up into middle class.

409
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,833
Something I can help him do.

410
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,125
You're the new India, Balram.

411
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,666
I am the new India, sir.

412
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,125
You can go.

413
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,000
[Balram] I didn't like the way
he had spoken about me.

414
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,166
"Half-baked." But he was right.

415
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,791
When you come to India, sir,

416
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,333
you'll meet hundreds
of millions of men like me.

417
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:54,250
Open up our brown skulls
and look inside with a penlight.

418
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:58,166
You'll find all these ideas,
half-formed, half-correct,

419
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,458
all buggering one another,
and that is what we live and act on.

420
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,166
[both speaking in Hindi]

421
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,666
[The Stork] Ah!

422
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,916
[in Hindi] Very good.
A little higher. Yeah, there.

423
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,875
[in English] Papa, India's future is in
outsourcing with American companies.

424
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,250
Our future is China. They're building
superhighways, they need coal,

425
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,458
and we sell coal.

426
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,666
But I really think we should diversify.
The IT sector is booming, the Internet--

427
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,791
Internet? What is that?

428
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,208
Coal is real. I can touch it.

429
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,208
No, sir. I learned from Ashok Sir,
the Internet is as real as a spider's web,

430
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:37,125
that it connects
all the human beings across--

431
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,041
-[in Hindi] Know what that was for?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,083
[in English] What for?

433
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,166
-For the Internet, sir.
-Hey!

434
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,125
You're pressing it too hard.
Papa is getting annoyed. Slow down.

435
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,083
[The Stork] Hmm.

436
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,666
[Ashok] Why do you hit the servants?

437
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,916
In America, they can sue you for that.

438
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,666
[The Stork] This is not America, son.

439
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,625
[in Hindi] They respect us for that.
Remember that.

440
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:57,083
Hey, a little higher.

441
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,166
[toilet flushing]

442
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,416
[sniffs]

443
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,291
[sniffing]

444
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,250
[The Mongoose] Hmm.

445
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,166
Count it.

446
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,333
I don't want to hear shit later.

447
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,750
[Balram in English]
I was only allowed to keep 200.

448
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,666
[in Hindi] Good, sir.

449
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,083
[in English] Granny sent Kishan
each month to take the rest back to her.

450
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,666
[in Hindi] And they're not
from the same caste. She's a Christian.

451
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,041
-And he married her?
-Yeah.

452
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,750
That's normal in America.

453
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,416
Her people were against it, too,
but he wouldn't listen.

454
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,000
-Is she American?
-No, no, she's Indian.

455
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,250
She was born here.
She moved there when she was 12.

456
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,750
She told me.

457
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,291
She talks to you?

458
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,625
Talks to me?

459
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,125
She tells me everything.

460
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,166
I'm their number one driver.

461
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,833
Are you serious?

462
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,416
Can I also come inside?

463
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,416
-It's not allowed.
-Why?

464
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,666
What do you mean, "why"?
If Mukesh sees, he'll scold me.

465
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,875
-Take care.
-Yes, you too.

466
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,083
[inhales deeply]

467
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,000
[grunting]

468
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,250
[sizzling]

469
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,625
[muezzin calling
on loudspeaker in distance]

470
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,333
[indistinct chatter]

471
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,375
[Balram in English] What a fool
I had been. It was Ramadan.

472
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,041
Of course he couldn't eat
and drink during the day.

473
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,750
The number one driver was a Muslim,
and the Stork hated Muslims.

474
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,458
-[car door opens]
-[footsteps approaching]

475
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,250
[car door closes]

476
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,416
[in Hindi] As long as there is a sun
and a moon, madam's name will remain!

477
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,166
Long live the madam!
Long live socialism!

478
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,750
[Balram in English] I almost fell down.

479
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,208
There was the woman I had seen
on a million election posters

480
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,416
since I was a boy.

481
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,291
The Great Socialist.

482
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,625
She was a low caste,
like me and everyone from the darkness.

483
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,208
Like a good entrepreneur,

484
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,625
she had pulled herself up
to become chief minister of our state.

485
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:14,666
She knew how to stick it to the rich,
and we liked her for that.

486
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,833
You take coal from the government mines

487
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,750
without paying taxes
because I let it happen.

488
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,291
[The Stork] And we have shown
our appreciation for that, madam.

489
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,583
Two million rupees is a little too much.

490
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,750
We'll be happy for some--

491
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,041
[in Hindi] Son! Come here.

492
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,833
-[in English] Did you need something?
-I can get it.

493
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,625
[The Great Socialist in Hindi]
Come here, son.

494
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,541
Come here, fucker!

495
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,291
Your rich employers
are trying to bugger me.

496
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,500
What do you say to that?

497
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,625
Driver, get lost.

498
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,583
Shut up, mother-fucker!

499
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,708
[in English] You don't want
to pay the government, pay me.

500
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,041
2.5 million rupees.

501
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,875
And I mean it!

502
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,958
[The Great Socialist spits]

503

837
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:22,583
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

838
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,458
Eat.

839
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,666
[speaks Hindi]

840
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,916
-You're not Ashok Sir.
-Did you not understand?

841
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,083
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

842
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,166
You're driving me insane.

843
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,625
[Kishan] Munna!

844
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,416
Where are you going? Stop!

845
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,333
What happened?

846
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,583
-You must keep sending money.
-I won't send it.

847
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,041
That's the family's money!

848
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,541
She's sucked the blood
out of you and left you a shell.

849
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

850
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,375
[Ashok in English] Why don't I eat meat?
Why does Pinky wear pants?

851
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,458
Why don't we have kids? They won't stop.

852
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,625
[Balram] I think
we should not go back there, sir.

853
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:21,958
[Ashok] Maybe.

854
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,625
[distant mooing]

855
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,041
You know, one in every three buildings
in India is built in Bangalore.

856
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:28,458
You know why?

857
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,625
-Outsourcing with the US.
-[Balram] Diversifying, sir?

858
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,625
[Ashok] Yeah, right. Not bad, Balram.

859
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,666
[Balram chuckles]

860
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,916
I'm thinking to offer financial services.

861
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,791
There's so many Wall Street firms I know.

862
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,458
I can drive you
to Bangalore right now, sir.

863
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,666
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.

864
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,250
-It's on the opposite side of the country.
-It's okay, sir.

865
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,416
I don't need sleep. I can drive all night.

866
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,125
No, thank you.

867
00:49:56,833 --> 00:50:00,208
I got to make a business plan first.
Do it the right way.

868
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,208
You will, sir. You will.

869
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,250
Yes. I will.

870
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,541
-[Pinky] Ashoky!
-Yeah?

871
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,583
[Balram] If only Mr. Ashok
was a real entrepreneur,

872
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,333
if only we had left for Bangalore
that very day,

873
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,583
then things would've
turned out differently for us.

874
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,541
Rich men are born
with opportunities they can waste.

875
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:27,416
[children chattering]

876
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,250
But a poor man?

877
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:37,416
Feels like, "Are we gonna go back home,
or does he want to stay here?"

878
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,291
You need to talk. Put your foot down.

879
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,833
Yeah, but he's not had
that conversation with me.

880
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,583
I think he's being vague
because he hasn't figured it out--

881
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,916
Balram! What are you doing?

882
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,291
-Your ginger teas, madam?
-With your hand.

883
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,875
[in Hindi] What's he doing?

884
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,791
[woman in English]
Pinky, this is disgusting.

885
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,000
Your uniform is filthy and your mouth
smells of that paan all day. Just…

886
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,625
Ugh! Just pick up this tea and leave.

887
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,833
-[in Hindi] Bring another cup.
-Yes, Madam.

888
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,250
After you wash your hands.

889
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,583
[Pinky in English]
He's not usually like that. I'm sorry.

890
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,125
[woman] These lower castes, na,
they're all the same.

891
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,458
-See you soon.
-[Pinky] Keep visiting, okay?

892
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,833
-[woman] Talk to Ashok, yeah?
-I will. Bye.

893
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,958
-Balram?
-Ji, madam?

894
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,125
[Pinky] Come here, please.

895
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,083
-Come here.
-Madam, I'm really sorry. I will stop.

896
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,416
-It's fine. Sit. Sit.
-I will stop eating paan, madam.

897
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,041
No. That's not what I'm… Just sit down.

898
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,416
I think it's wrong
the way you work for us.

899
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,708
You should be finishing your education,
starting your own family.

900
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,875
Ashok Sir and you are family to me, madam.

901
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,333
-Don't say that. That's not true, Balram.
-Really, madam.

902
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,833
No, you can't possibly believe that.

903
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,750
Do you know what my parents do in America?

904
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,541
They run this shitty little bodega
in Jackson Heights,

905
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,291
selling beer, paan, and porn.

906
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,500
I used to do my homework in the basement.

907
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:59,208
One night I saw my mom
being held at gunpoint,

908
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,458
and she still finished
working the entire night.

909
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,500
I got out, Balram.

910
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,625
What is it that you want to do?

911
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,583
-I want to serve you and Ashok Sir.
-No.

912
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,166
-Okay, stop. No.
-Really, madam.

913
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,958
Stop saying that. That's why this
caste system thing is total bullshit.

914
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,458
You know, Mukesh tried
to stop Ashok from marrying me

915
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,291
because of this caste thing.

916
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,416
Well, fuck him.

917
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,166
And fuck that.

918
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,333
[sniffs]

919
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,458
[indistinct chatter]

920
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,625
-[Balram in Hindi] Is this toothpaste?
-Yes, it's terrific, whiten your teeth.

921
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,500
-Where can I find something for an itch?
-[man 1] The medicine shop.

922
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,541
[man 2] Five hundred!

923
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,375
-Are these for the office?
-Yep, take a look.

924
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:17,083
[man 2] Those are 200.
This is leather, better quality.

925
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,083
[Balram speaking Hindi]

926
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,583
Hundred-rupee sale!

927
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:26,541
-How much?
-A hundred rupees sale!

928
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,708
Pick any one.

929
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,166
And 250 for the pant.

930
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,000
It's a good designer pant.

931
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,541
[Balram in English] Why had my father
never told me not to scratch my groin?

932
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,250
Why had he never taught me
to brush my teeth?

933
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,083
Why had he raised me
to live like such an animal?

934
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:07,541
If only a man
could spit his past out so easily.

935
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,833
If you asked me to explain
how one event connects to another

936
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,041
or how one motive
strengthens or weakens the next,

937
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,125
I'll tell you
I don't understand these things.

938
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,166
[squishing]

939
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,916
I should warn you
my story gets much darker from here.

940
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,500
[Pinky] Is something going
to jump out at me?

941
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,625
[Pinky chuckles]

942
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,208
Oh, my gosh!

943
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,625
Happy birthday, madam.
Wish you many happy returns of the day.

944
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:59,041
-Oh, baboo. That's great.
-How's he looking?

945
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,541
-Please come in, Mr. Maharaja.
-Come in.

946
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,666
[muffled dance music playing]

947
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,125
[indistinct chatter]

948
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,791
[in Hindi] Hey! Country Mouse!

949
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,375
[makes kissing sound]

950
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,958
Don't stand there alone.
Come hang with us.

951
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,291
Standing alone leads to bad thoughts.

952
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,708
Look at him!
Dressed like the maharaja of England!

953
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,291
[driver 1] Hope you haven't
peed your pants.

954
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,208
Someone get him a diaper.

955
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,208
[cackling]

956
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:25,291
-[driver 1] Asshole!
-[driver 2] I'll lube you up…

957
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,958
[driver 1] How's your room?

958
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:31,000
[driver 2] Are there cockroaches in there?

959
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,250
[strong wind blowing]

960
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,625
-[Ashok in English] It's fine…
-So great. Oh, my gosh, babe, he's asleep.

961
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,791
-Balram!
-No! Don't wake him up! He's sleeping.

962
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,583
-How do we get home? Just wait--
-[clicks tongue]

963
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,333
Let me do it. I'll do it gently.
[in sing-song voice] Balram.

964
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,666
[loudly] Balram!

965
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,750
[Pinky and Ashok laughing]

966
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,583
Oh, my God.
I think he just shat his pants.

967
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,791
I'm so sorry.

968
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,583
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry. You okay?
-Oh, shit.

969
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,416
-Are you okay?
-You okay? Huh?

970
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,666
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Come on, don't cry.

971
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,833
-[in Hindi] I dozed off.
-[Pinky in English] Sorry.

972
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:08,750
No problem.

973
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,875
[Hindi song playing on car radio]

974
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,958
[Ashok and Pinky moaning]

975
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:34,583
Pinky, stop, stop.
Stop, Pinky. We're not alone.

976
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,041
What? It's just Balram.

977
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,458
[Ashok] Yeah, but…

978
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,333
[Pinky] It doesn't matter, babe.
Come on. Come on, man.

979
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,333
[Ashok] You're so fucking drunk.

980
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:50,458
[Pinky] I'm not drunk enough.
I want to go back to New York.

981
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,583
-Not this again.
-"Again"?

982
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,500
What do you mean, "Not this again"?
You never wanna talk about it.

983
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,708
When we said we're coming to India,
it was supposed to be for six months.

984
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:02,791
You don't talk to me about it because
you've decided that you want to stay here.

985
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,208
I'm trying to help my family.
I owe it to them.

986
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,833
[Pinky] Can we not talk about them?

987
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:11,583
You know, you're like a non-entity
in front of them, you know that?

988
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:14,000
It's like…

989
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,250
It's like skim milk.

990
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,041
Nobody likes skim milk.

991
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:25,458
[muffled music playing on car radio]

992
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,291
[Ashok] We can go to a bar…

993
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,750
Oh, my God. Wait.

994
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:33,833
Hi, precious!

995
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:36,125
[in Hindi] Take it, madam.
Only 100 rupees.

996
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,666
I'm very hungry.

997
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,875
Can I see?

998
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,583
-Ji.
-[chuckles]

999
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,791
Please, madam. Take three for 200.

-I'm hungry.
-Don't touch the car.

1001

I'll tell the judge the truth or run away.

I would have to accept

[in English] From now on,
I'll only eat your kind of food.

1329
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:27,916
[laughing]

1330
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,041
[Balram] And I only want
to eat your kind of food.

1331
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:32,166
[Ashok] You know
the real India better than me.

1332
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,333
You know, my mom,

1333
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,833
she was the one who encouraged me
to go to America and study.

1334
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,458
Pinky really loved her.

1335
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:53,041
You know, sir, Pinky Madam told me
that you are a great man

1336
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,458
who is going to do
great things in India, sir.

1337
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:59,541
-When did she say that?
-The morning she left.

1338
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,083
She was crying the entire way
to the airport, sir. [clicks tongue]

1339
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,375
And she told me that you will not
let Mukesh Sir tell you what to do.

1340
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,583
And that she believes in you.

1341
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,583
[bell chiming]

1342
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,291
She'll come back to you, sir.

1343
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,333
Yeah.

1344
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:35,708
She's coming back. I can feel it.

1345
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,666
I can feel it, too, sir.

1346
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,458
[coins clattering]

1347
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,291
How are you?

1348
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:13,708
[in Hindi] Go get the car.

1349
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,666
[in English] Get the car.

1350
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:20,625
Divorce?

1351
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:22,916
She said that?

1352
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,625
-Don't worry. I'm handling it.
-[Ashok] You're probably happy she's gone.

1353
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,541
[Mukesh] That's not true.
I want your happiness, bhai.

1354
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,791
-I'm gonna go there and talk to her.
-Wait, stop. Ashok.

1355
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:36,375
-No, I need to talk to her--
-You can't call her like this.

1356
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,541
Stop pleading like this. You'll regret it.

1357
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:44,333
The only thing I regret
is letting her drive that night.

1358
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,666
-[Mukesh] It's not your fault. You know.
-It is my fault.

1359
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,041
[Mukesh] Listen, I can stay
with you as long as you like.

1360
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,083
Let me order that pizza which you like,
that macaroni one. [chuckles]

1361
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,958
[Ashok] I'm sorry, bhai. Without you, I'd…

1362
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:01,416
[in Hindi]
Look what I brought for you, sir.

1363
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,208
Nice and hot okra.

1364
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:06,541
-[in English] I don't want food right now.
-Just like we had the other night, sir.

1365
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:09,125
[in Hindi] Nice and crispy, check it out.

1366
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,416
[in English] I don't give a shit.

1367
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,166
[in Hindi]
Don't say that. Have a little bit.

1368
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,500
[in English] I'm not hungry!

1369
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:17,958
Get lost, please.

1370
01:26:18,916 --> 01:26:20,958
[in Hindi] He doesn't feel like it.
Why're you up in his ass?

1371
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,166
Get rid of it, sister-fucker!

1372
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,333
[Ashok in English] Can you just
leave me alone for a second?

1373
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:27,666
[in Hindi] Until Ashok Sir calls you,
don't hover like a fly!

1374
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,166
Yes, sir.

1375
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:48,041
[Balram in English] The desire to be
a servant had been bred into me,

1376
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,458
poured into my blood,
hammered into my skull.

1377
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,583
Ninety-three hundred rupees,
a strange sum,

1378
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:59,958
almost three months my salary
but not quite.

1379
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,000
Maybe she started with 10,000
and then deducted 700?

1380
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,208
No, no, no.

1381
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,291
That is not how rich people think.

1382
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:11,500
[chuckling] Have you not
learned anything, you idiot?

1383
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:15,333
If she thought she owed you 10,000,
she truly owed you ten times more.

1384
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:18,833
Ten times more. No! A hundred times more.
A hundred times more.

1385
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:20,041
[panting]

1386
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:26,666
They made me sign that confession,
and I asked for nothing in return.

1387
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:30,625
Why did I not ask?
I didn't even think to ask.

1388
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:33,625
I didn't even think to ask.

1389
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:42,000
[in Hindi] Have you ever thought about
what happens to you in the future?

1390
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:43,791
Eyes.

1391
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:47,083
As long as you have eyes, you'll work.

1392
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:50,541
But when you turn 50-55,
they'll kick your ass out.

1393
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,291
And then?

1394
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,916
If you've saved some money,
you can buy a little shack.

1395
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,708
But if you're clever like me
and earn extra money, then maybe more.

1396
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:02,416
That's the best case scenario.

1397
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,583
Imagine your boss
kicks you out without any reason.

1398
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:07,125
Or you get into an accident!

1399
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:08,791
You'll be dead!

1400
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,583
Or homeless.

1401
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,291
[Hindi song playing]

1402
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,500
Hey, Country Mouse…

1403
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:21,791
[in English] Everything's fine?

1404
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:22,958
[in Hindi] First class.

1405
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,041
I hate to tell you this,
but all the drivers are talking about you.

1406
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,000
That you sit in your boss' car alone…

1407
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,000
muttering away to yourself.

1408
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,958
Is it true?

1409
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:41,833
[gunshots on TV]

1410
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,250
[Balram in English]
I would not let him tell me…

1411
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,250
my fate was a shack in a slum.

1412
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:01,833
Over the next weeks, I learned the ways
drivers cheat their masters.

1413
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,000
[both speaking Hindi]

1414
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:13,916
[Balram in English] Number one,
give your master phony invoices

1415
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,083
for repairs that are not necessary.

1416
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:19,375
Thank you, sir.

1417
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:27,583
Two, sell your master's petrol
to other drivers.

1418
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,166
As you gain confidence,

1419
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:37,208
cruise around picking up
and dropping off paying customers.

1420
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:39,875
Delhi has many pickup points.

1421
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,708
Over time, you will learn them all.

1422
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:43,666
[speaks Hindi]

1423
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:47,708
[Balram in English] When I looked
at that cash, I didn't feel guilt.

1424
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:48,791
[car honking]

1425
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,375
I felt rage.

1426
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,375
There are only two castes in India.

1427
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:57,166
I was growing a belly at last.

1428
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,750
[in Hindi] Ashok Sir,
I'll fuck your mother.

1429
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,375
I'm trying to drive.
I can't pay attention like this.

1430
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:04,500
Take this.

1431
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,625
Take it!

1432
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:09,875
You're a eunuch,
you motherfucker! A eunuch!

1433
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,083
[in English] I know what you were doing.

1434
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,166
Sir, please don't get upset with me.

1435
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,041
You were at the temple
offering prayers for my health.

1436
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:24,541
Yes, sir.

1437
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,291
Yes, sir. I was so worried for you, sir.

1438
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:31,916
[in Hindi] I made an offering
of 101 rupees in your name.

1439
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,541
[in English] Come inside. Sit with me.

1440
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:35,166
Come.

1441
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:38,458
Come here.

1442
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:42,500
Is this really where you live?

1443
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:46,833
It's so damp, and the smell…

1444
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,833
This place is like
the Taj Mahal for me, sir.

1445
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:51,375
-Taj Mahal… [chuckles]
-Yes, sir.

1446
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:54,583
Taj Mahal is a tomb, Balram.
You don't live in Taj Mahal.

1447
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,041
Okay, sir.

1448
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:01,000
I have never done
what I wanted to do with my life.

1449
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,583
What did you want to do, sir?

1450
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,125
Music.

1451
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,166
Or produce it anyway.

1452
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,875
You know,
I lived in the US for so many years,

1453
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:13,833
and I'd try to be like them.

1454
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:17,708
[in Hindi] But I'm fucking
Indian at heart, after all.

1455
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,916
Absolutely, sir.

1456
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,916
[in English] But we're fucking Indians.

1457
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:25,625
I want to go to Bangalore
and change my country's future.

1458

That's what I want to do.

[chuckles]

1494
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,250
[indistinct chatter]

1495
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:31,583
[Balram in English] I see you've arrived
in my glorious capital, sir.

1496
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:34,750
Perhaps we can have
a drink when you visit Bangalore.

1497
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:38,416
You know, I would not be able to afford
even one Johnnie Walker Black

1498
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,875
with the money I cheated
from my ex-employer,

1499
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:44,833
or get a room in this five-star hotel
with the money Pinky Madam had given me.

1500
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:51,291
Men born in the light, like my master,
have the choice to be good.

1501
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:57,583
Men born in the coop, like me,
we don't have that choice.

1502
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:00,291
[male reporter on car radio]
The opposition party and underdog,

1503
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:03,291
the Great Socialist,
hopes for support from rural India.

1504
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:04,708
[Mukesh] Her party is a mess.

1505
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,041
This government is
going to win this time for sure.

1506
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,166
We just need to keep paying them
until the elections.

1507
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,583
[Ashok] I can't keep doing this.

1508
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:13,125
[Mukesh] Things will change,
and then you do what you want to do.

1509
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,625
-[Ashok] It's getting tough.
-[Mukesh in Hindi] What the fuck was that?

1510
01:34:15,708 --> 01:34:18,250
[in English] Who told you
to do that? Can you believe that?

1511
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,708
Why did you give him money, Balram?

1512
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,250
[in Hindi] Turn off the radio, asshole!

1513
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,708
This sister-fucker thinks
he's doing charity.

1514
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:24,833
[in English] Why'd he do that?

1515
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:26,375
[in Hindi]
Is that your father's money, dickhead?

1516
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:30,875
-[in English] Who do you think you are?
-Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

1517
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:35,500
[indistinct conversation]

1518
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,958
[Balram] Be careful
what you say around drivers.

1519
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:40,375
We have grown skilled at reading lips.

1520
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:43,000
I was certain
I saw the Mongoose say my name,

1521
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,291
and then a word no servant wants to hear,

1522
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:47,208
"replacement."

1523
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,958
-To the Parliament House.
-Ji, sir.

1524
01:34:58,541 --> 01:34:59,708
My phone. [sighs]

1525
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,041
Just keep it in the car.

1526
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,833
[Balram] This was at least
two years' salary, maybe three.

1527
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,208
I was worth more.

1528
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,541
Over the next days,
I tried hard not to look at the red bag.

1529
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:03,541
The city knew
something was burning inside of me,

1530
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,166
and she burned too.

1531
01:36:15,708 --> 01:36:17,000
[horn honking]

1532
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:21,750
[Balram in Hindi] Dad?

1533
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,375
Even if you were to steal it…
it wouldn't be stealing.

1534
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:31,375
Mr. Ashok bribes politicians
in order not to pay taxes.

1535
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,041
So who is he stealing from?

1536
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,166
The ordinary people of this country.

1537
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,666
Me.

1538
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And you.

1539
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:43,458
[vehicle horns blaring]

1540
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:44,625
[Ashok in English] Let's go.

1541
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,541
Balram, hey? Let's go.

1542
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,125
It'll be a couple of hours.

1543
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:05,000
[horn honking]

1544
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:09,416
[muffled announcement on PA system]

1545
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:27,375
[Balram] What would my destination be
if I came here with the red bag?

1546
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:33,000
-[dogs barking]
-[pigeons fluttering]

1547
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:36,875
The pigeons, the dog, the station.

1548
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,250
They could sense it.

1549
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:41,625
A rooster was trying
to escape from the coop.

1550
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:46,750
What would Mr. Ashok do to my family?

1551
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,166
[baby wailing]

1552
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:05,916
-[gunshot]
-[babies wailing]

1553
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,625
-Sir?
-Yeah?

1554
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,125
Sir, there is something…

1555
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:55,666
There is something
I want to tell you, sir.

1556
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:57,500
Yeah. Go ahead.

1557
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:04,000
Sir, I want to smash your skull
and steal your money.

1558
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:07,875
[Ashok] I know what you're thinking.

1559
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,458
You miss home, don't you?

1560
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:12,500
Yes, sir.

1561
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:14,625
Plan a trip back.

1562
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:17,083
And…

1563
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:23,541
Don't worry about the expenses. Here.

1564
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:27,625
-Yeah? Good night.
-Yes, sir.

1565
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:39,541
[Balram] He only gave me
enough for a one-way ticket.

1566
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,583
[indistinct chatter]

1567
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:57,250
[children speaking Hindi]

1568
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:18,166
[laughing]

1569
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:31,708
[both laughing maniacally]

1570
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:45,375
[male reporter on car radio]
Upending all expectations

1571
01:40:45,458 --> 01:40:47,500
-and with the support of the poor…
-[cheering and shouting]

1572
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,125
…the Great Socialist has won
a vast majority of the votes

1573
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:53,083
saying, "There is no water in our taps,

1574
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:55,750
and what did
the rich politicians in Delhi give us?"

1575
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:56,666
"Cellphones."

1576
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:59,250
"Can a poor man drink
a phone when he is thirsty?"

1577
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:00,583
[Ashok] We went to the wrong side.

1578
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:02,916
-[in Hindi] Turn that shit off, asshole!
-[radio turns off]

1579
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,208
[in English]
I can't hear you. Say that again?

1580
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,541
-[indistinct shouting]
-I get it. Move! Back off!

1581
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah. All the idiot villagers
voted for her.

1582
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:15,541
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

1583
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:18,416
[in Hindi] Drive, sister-fucker!
Why'd you come this way?

1584
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,833
[drums beating]

1585
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:25,250
[crowd chanting in Hindi]
Long live socialism!

1586
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:29,916
[chanting gets louder]

1587
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,750
[vehicles honking]

1588
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:43,375
[Ashok in English] Father sends
his warm congratulations.

1589
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:45,625
We're all very happy for your success.

1590
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:47,291
So sweet of you.

1591
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:52,083
As a matter of fact, we would like
to show our appreciation by donating

1592
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:54,041
one million rupees to your party.

1593
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,583
[in Hindi] Is that how much you paid
the opposition party, fucker?

1594
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:02,416
We want four million rupees.
Monday night, Sheraton Hotel.

1595
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,458
Got it?

1596
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:40,666
[in Hindi] I took a bus
from the village, then caught a train…

1597
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:44,583
and got here
after asking around about you.

1598
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:49,291
Granny said you would look after me

1599
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:51,250
and help me become a driver.

1600
01:42:55,208 --> 01:42:56,666
-Who are you?
-Dharam.

1601
01:42:57,416 --> 01:42:59,041
Aunt Lattu's fourth son.

1602
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,500
-What's in your hand?
-A letter.

1603
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:04,625
-A letter?
-Hmm.

1604
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:05,750
Show it to me.

1605
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:12,958
[sighs]

1606
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:20,708
[Kusum] My dear grandson,
it has been seven months and two days…

1607
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,791
since you sent us money.

1608
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,791
The city has corrupted your soul.

1609
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:31,000
Life has become hard here.
Lord Indra is unhappy.

1610
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:35,166
You must send us money again.

1611
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:40,166
I have arranged for your wedding.

1612
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:46,541
If you don't come here,
we will send the girl to you by bus.

1613
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,750
If you refuse,

1614
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,833
we will write a letter explaining
everything and send it to your master.

1615
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:53,833
[paper rustling]

1616
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,458
[Balram] Is she really
going to marry me off?

1617
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:01,041
[Dharam in English] Yes, uncle.

1618
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:04,791
Turn around, I'm going to hit you again.

1619
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:07,541
Turn around!

1620
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:14,541
[sighs]

1621
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:37,041
[Balram] The next morning,
Mr. Ashok did something he had never done.

1622
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:37,958
[Ashok] Who is this?

1623
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,916
[Balram] He gave me a day off.

1624
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,208
-[Ashok] Your nephew?
-Ji, sir. My family.

1625
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:43,958
[speaks Hindi]

1626
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:47,916
[Balram in English] But by now, I knew
the rich never give anything for free.

1627
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:53,500
[indistinct conversation]

1628
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,208
He had found my replacement.

1629
01:45:01,416 --> 01:45:02,666
[grunting]

1630
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:20,500
That's when we saw the creature that
gets born only once every generation…

1631
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:23,833
the white tiger.

1632
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:13,250
Iqbal, that great Muslim poet,
was right when he wrote,

1633
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,250
"The moment you recognize
what is beautiful in this world,

1634
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:19,458
you stop being a slave."

1635
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:36,291
I hoped the next morning
when I didn't return,

1636
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,291
he'd know to run.

1637
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,125
-[car door closes]
-[engine starts]

1638
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:53,583
[rain pattering]

1639
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,083
[thunder rumbling]

1640
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:14,166
The Sheraton, sir?

1641
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:17,208
Yeah, the Sheraton.

1642
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,750
[Ashok] Pinky called.

1643
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:30,708
She wants to know
if I'll move back to New York.

1644
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,875
Will you be going, sir?

1645
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:38,166
And pretend to be someone I'm not?
This is my country after all.

1646
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:48,500
There is a story about a cunning Brahmin
trying to trick the Buddha?

1647
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:51,000
The Brahmin asks,

1648
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:55,500
"Master, do you consider
yourself man or God?"

1649
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:59,625
To which the Buddha smiles
and says, "Neither."

1650
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:05,125
"I'm just one who has woken up
while the rest of you are still sleeping."

1651
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:35,875
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?

1652
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:38,125
There is something wrong
with the wheel, sir.

1653
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:40,750
Just give me a minute, sir. I'll go check.

1654
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:41,708
Okay.

1655
01:50:09,541 --> 01:50:12,166
-What happened?
-There's something off with the wheel.

1656
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:13,625
Okay.

1657
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:16,583
Maybe we should call for help.

1658
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:18,541
-Huh, sir?
-We should call for help!

1659
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,416
Sir, who will come here, sir?

1660

-Yeah.

1667

They are extraordinary men

1685

Not me. I didn't leave this room
for four weeks until my nerves were calm.

1686
01:54:39,416 --> 01:54:41,666
The last stage in my amazing success story

1687
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:45,083
was to go from social entrepreneur
to business entrepreneur.

1688
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:46,666
This was not easy.

1689
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:50,541
But I had an edge.

1690
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:53,750
I had come to Bangalore,
and Mr. Ashok had told me the future.

1691
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:56,083
Outsourcing.

1692

[woman laughing]

1693
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:12,625
When I saw all those drivers

1694
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:15,375
coming in and out
of the call centers to America,

1695
01:55:16,083 --> 01:55:17,791
I knew what my place would be.

1696
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:22,625
But how would I
get rid of the competition?

1697

[indistinct chatter]

1698
01:55:26,833 --> 01:55:29,708
Then I wondered,
"What would Mr. Ashok do?"

1699

[cop] Sir!

1700
01:55:34,291 --> 01:55:35,291
Namaste, sir.

1701
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:39,541
I just wanted to make
a small offering of my gratitude to you.

1702
01:55:41,041 --> 01:55:41,875
For what?

1703
01:55:42,416 --> 01:55:44,583
For all the good
you're going to do for me.

1704
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:55,041
Don't worry.
It wasn't all of it, but it was enough.

1705
01:55:57,375 --> 01:55:59,333
You know why they never found me?

1706
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:02,500
Because my face could be
the face of half the men in India.

White Tiger Drivers.

1712
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:24,458
I've got 30 drivers
who work in shifts with 26 vehicles,

1713
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:27,041
all air-conditioned for the summer months.

1714
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:30,333
Put together with my bank holdings,

1715
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:34,416
and I am worth 15 times the sum
I borrowed from Mr. Ashok.

1716
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:38,875

Yes, Ashok.

1719
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:49,458
That's what I call myself these days.

1720
01:56:51,416 --> 01:56:54,125
But I don't treat
my drivers like servants.

1721
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:58,750
I don't care about their religion,
and I certainly don't call them my family.

1722
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:00,708
They are my employees.

1723
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:03,708
I make them sign a contract,
and I sign it too.

1724
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:08,041
And if there is a problem,

1725
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:10,166
I don't let my drivers take the blame.

1726
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,541
[man] Can't we take him to the hospital?

1727

That's the brother of the dead boy.

1728
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:15,708
And your driver
that hit him is right there.

I am the owner of this vehicle.
The blood is on my hands, not my driver.

that has happened, but it's late…

differently than my masters.

at the loss of your son, aunty.

I don't give it to you
because I need to, but because I want to.

[Balram in Kannada] Do you understand?

1738

And I want to help your other son.

1739
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:48,375
He can come and be a driver with me,
and I will take care of him.

Ah, I should have cut the Mongoose's neck.

1744

[Balram] I'll never know
what happened to my family.

1745
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,916
I could only wonder.

1746
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:30,416
But for the poor,
there are only two ways to get to the top,

1747
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,625
crime or politics.

and then gets nightmares

about the dead man pursuing him,

It doesn't happen like that.

1782
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:35,041
The real nightmare is the other kind
where you feel like you didn't do it,

that you didn't kill your master,
that you lost your nerve,
